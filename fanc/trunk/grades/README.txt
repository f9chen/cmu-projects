You should not edit files in this directory.  If you do (or if you use
a program that implicitly edits them) you will get an error if you later
commit this directory back to the repository.  If this problem occurs,
delete the grades directory (including all hidden files and subdirectories)
and recover the grades files by running "svn update" in the repository
trunk.
