Your score: 82 / 100

1. No of courses not updated in welcome pages
2. Able to join same course (creates an entry in your enrollment table). Taking no points off, but fix this bug.
3. Cross site scripting is not handled. : -5
for example, scripts like <script>alert("touch me baby!");</script>
<p>new</p><p>york</p> are able to make a mess on the website.
4. Also, when you make a war file, please take into consideration that it SHOULD be deployable. 
I was not able to deploy it because of one level of directory that your submission had. I had to make war again.
For next hw, points may be taken off.
5. Duplicate userwebsite just hangs due to unhandled MyDAOException: -5
Also duplicate course creation has not been handled. So that means you did not think about concurrency. -3
6. Development process/ svn usage: NO (-5)
