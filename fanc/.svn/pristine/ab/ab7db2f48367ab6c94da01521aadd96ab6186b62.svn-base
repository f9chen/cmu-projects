Very nicely done! The Sign In button should link to the Your Courses page, but I'm not taking off points because I can get to the Your Courses page using the nav bar at the top.

Good job! It's clear you spent a lot of time getting your site to look nice. However, there were a lot of problems with your HTML (-1). For instance, you use a nonstandard IMAGE tag instead of the standard IMG tag. The only reason that worked is because Firefox is a lenient Web browser.
